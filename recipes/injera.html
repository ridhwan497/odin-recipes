			<h2><u>Description</u></h2>
			<p>As the name suggests, this is an Ethiopian based cuisine. While i am not a born Ethiopian i am a huge fan of this dish because i used to have a neighbour who always used to bring us this as an apology for keeping us awake all night with all the noise. It used to be packed with some lentil soup made so creamy and spicy that you lick your fingers off and ultimately forgive her for the noise.<br> I do not know the recipe for the soup but the Injera i can provide:</p>

			<h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
			<ul>
				<li>2 cups teff flour (fermented or non-fermented)</li>
				<li>3 cups water</li>
				<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
			</ul>
			<h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
			<ol>
				<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the teff flour and water. Mix well to form a smooth batter. If you're using fermented teff flour, let the batter sit at room temperature for 24-48 hours to ferment. If using non-fermented teff flour, you can proceed immediately.</li>
				<li>Add the salt to the batter and mix thoroughly</li>
				<li>Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the batter rest for at least 6-8 hours at room temperature. This resting period allows the flavors to develop and the batter to slightly ferment.</li>
				<li>Heat a non-stick skillet or a large injera pan over medium heat. Make sure the surface is hot before pouring the batter.</li>
				<li>Pour a ladleful of the batter onto the center of the skillet, then quickly tilt and swirl the skillet in a circular motion to spread the batter into a thin, round shape</li>
				<li>Cook the injera for about 2-3 minutes, until the surface is covered with small bubbles and the edges start to curl up slightly.</li>
				<li>Remove the injera from the skillet and let it cool on a clean kitchen towel.
					Repeat the process with the remaining batter until you have made all the injera.</li>
			</ol>
